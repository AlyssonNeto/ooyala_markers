Work in Progress!

This module implements a new CCK field type which when added to a content type in conjunction with an ooyala video field provided by ooyala.module allows you to specify chapter titles/times. When displayed user's can click the chapter title and the Ooyala player will jump to the chapter time.

There are bugs in Ooyala module that should be worked out before including this with the package.
